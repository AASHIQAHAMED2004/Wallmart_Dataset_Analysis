# Walmart Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Walmart Dataset Analysis project repository! This project focuses on analyzing the features, stores, train, and test datasets provided by Walmart. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), gain insights into the data, and potentially build predictive models to forecast sales or other relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following files:

- `features.csv`: Contains additional information about the features, including store number, date, and various metrics such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
- `stores.csv`: Provides details about each store, including store number, type, and size.
- `train.csv`: Contains historical sales data for Walmart stores, including store number, department number, date, weekly sales, and whether there was a holiday event.
- `test.csv`: Similar to the train dataset but without the weekly sales column. This dataset is typically used for evaluating predictive models.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset files.
- `unemployment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for performing data analysis on the Walmart dataset, including EDA, visualization, and potentially building predictive models.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
